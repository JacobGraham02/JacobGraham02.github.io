                            Hello! I am a recent Honours Computer Science graduate who graduated in June 2024 with first-class standing. I have an Honours
                            Computer Science degree from Lakehead University, and a Computer Programming diploma from Georgian College.

                        <p class="about_me_paragraph"><span class="about_me_paragraph_span"></span> 
                            I am a diligent and dynamic individual with a strong academic background and hands-on experience in software development. My professional experience includes a Quality Engineering internship at TD Canada Trust, where I improved project completion time by 30% through enhanced documentation and increased code coverage by 15% with automated test suites. I also provided personalized academic support as a private tutor, helping students develop effective study strategies.
                        </p>

                            My software development journey encompasses the complete software lifecycle, from design and implementation to testing and stakeholder presentations. I am proficient in multiple programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, HTML5, CSS, and TypeScript. My specialization lies in developing web and desktop applications, with additional experience in mobile application development using Java.

                                <p><strong>Student Bot Helper</strong></p>
                                <p>I developed this project for the Lakehead University CS 2020 - 2024 class to assist students in their studies by relieving them of menial and repetitive work, such as keeping track of due dates.</p>
                                <p>Student Bot Helper is a Discord bot which acts as a platform for all-things related to school: due dates, class times, homework help, and even directions via Google Maps! It was developed using Discord's REST API, TypeScript, Node.js, MySQL, Microsoft Azure, the Google Places API, and the Google Directions API.</p>
                                <p>This Discord bot uses Discord's REST API to allow the user to interact with the Discord bot. From there, users can use the '/help' command to find out more.</p>

                                <p><strong>Scum Chat Monitor</strong></p>
                                <p>I developed this project for my personal SCUM server to make players' experience more intuitive by <i>automating the boring parts</i>, providing an in-game chat integration bot.</p>
                                <p>Scum Chat Monitor is an in-game integration bot which adds the following features to the base game: new player teleportation to safe zone, welcome package, in-game kit packages, Discord bot integration, and more!</p>
                                <p>It was developed using Discord's REST API, Node.js, JavaScript, MongoDB, Windows Powershell, and GPortal's FTP Server.</p>

                                <p>I am currently developing Monster Assault as a mobile game which seeks to re-create the experience of recently-deleted SAS Zombie Assault 1, a game which was only available on a computer.</p>
                                <p>Relative to my other 2 projects, Monster Assault is light on the technologies used, only utilizing Java and LibGDX. However, I am leaning heavily into learning all aspects of mobile application development, from appealing user interface design to proper application architecture and back-end integrations.</p>
