                            Hello there! I am currently an Honours Computer Science student in my fourth (senior) year in University with an intended graduation date of 
                            May 2024. Because I am in a program offered by a partnership between Lakehead University and Georgian College, I will receive both a 
                            Computer Programming diploma from Georgian College and an Honours Bachelor of Arts Computer Science degree from Lakehead University.  
                        </p>

                        <p class="about_me_paragraph"><span class="about_me_paragraph_span"></span> 
                            I am a diligent and dynamic individual when tackling academic assignments, personal projects, and when contributing to work projects,
                            able to effectively communicate my ideas with shareholders by explaining complex software applications and systems in an easily-understood manner. 
                            My approach to teamwork is characterized by my collaborative mindset, valuing cooperation and mutual support. Additionally, I possess excellent
                            communication skills, allowing me to engage effectively with stakeholders and clients.

                            My software development journey encompasses the complete software lifecycle, from software and system design, implementation, and testing, to 
                            creating pitches for key stakeholders regarding the software application. I have a versatile skill set encompassing various programming languages, 
                            including Java, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, HTML5, CSS, and TypeScript. While my specialization lies in developing web and desktop applications, I am
                            equally capable of creating mobile applications using Java. 
                        </p>

                                <p>I developed this project for the Lakehead University CS 2020 - 2024 class to assist students in their studies by relieving them of menial and repetitive work, such as keeping track of due dates.</p>
                                <p>Student Bot Helper is a Discord bot which acts as a platform for all-things related to school: due dates, class times, homework help, and even directions via Google Maps! It was developed using Discord's REST API, TypeScript, Node.js, MySQL, Microsoft Azure, the Google Places API, and the Google Directions API.</p>
                                <p>This Discord bot uses Discord's REST API to allow the user to interact with the Discord bot. From there, users can use the '/help' command to find out more.</p>

                                <p>Scum Chat Monitor is an in-game integration bot which adds the following features to the base game: new player teleportation to safe zone, welcome package, in-game kit packages, Discord bot integration, and more!</p>

                                <p>I am currently developing Monster Assault as a mobile game which seeks to re-create the experience of recently-deleted SAS Zombie Assault 1, a game which was only available on a computer.</p>
                                <p>Relative to my other 2 projects, Monster Assault is light on the technologies used, only utilizing Java and LibGDX. However, I am leaning heavily into learning all aspects of mobile application development, from appealing user interface design to proper application architecture and back-end integrations.</p>
